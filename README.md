I am not really proud of how it looks, but at least the functionality is there and is working.

By completing the Rock-Paper-Scissors project from The Odin Project, I have learned the following skills:

How to use HTML and CSS to create a simple user interface for a game
How to use JavaScript to create a game logic and implement game mechanics
How to use variables, loops, and control structures in JavaScript to control the flow of a program
How to use functions and event listeners in JavaScript to respond to user input and update the game state
How to use basic debugging techniques, such as using console.log statements and the debugger keyword, to find and fix errors in my code
